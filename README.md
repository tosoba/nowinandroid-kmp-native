> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is a port of [**Now in Android**](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid), designed
> and built by the Android team at Google and licensed under Apache 2.0. All of the product design,

## Platforms

The same design system, feature modules, and data layer produce four applications:

| Platform | Module           | Run                                                                                                                        |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Android  | `app/androidApp` | `./gradlew :app:androidApp:installDebug`                                                                                   |
| iOS      | `app/iosApp`     | `./scripts/generate-xcodeproj.sh` then open `app/iosApp/NowInAndroid.xcodeproj`                                            |
| Desktop  | `app/desktopApp` | `./gradlew :app:desktopApp:run`                                                                                            |
| Web      | `app/webApp`     | `./gradlew :app:webApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun`, or open the [live demo](https://skydoves.github.io/nowinandroid-kmp/) |

The iOS project is generated from `app/iosApp/project.yml`
with [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), and its "Compile Kotlin" build phase runs
`:app:shared:embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode`.

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries

- [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html)
  with [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/), targeting Android,
  iOS (arm64 + simulator arm64), desktop (JVM), and the browser (wasmJs).
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/)
  for asynchronous work, exactly as upstream.
- [Metro](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro): compile-time dependency injection, replacing Hilt,
  which has no Kotlin/Native support. One `@DependencyGraph` per platform, every binding resolved at
  compile time, including the assisted `TopicViewModel` and `InterestsViewModel`.
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/): the HTTP client, with the engine each platform ships (OkHttp on Android
  and desktop, Darwin on iOS, `fetch` in the browser). Replaces Retrofit + OkHttp.
- [Sandwich](https://github.com/skydoves/sandwich): every network call returns `ApiResponse`, so an
  HTTP error and a transport failure are two inspectable results rather than one thrown exception.
  `changeListSync` logs the typed failure before it unwraps.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform/room) 3: the offline-first cache on
  every platform, FTS search included. The bundled native SQLite driver on Android, iOS and desktop;
  `androidx.sqlite:sqlite-web` over a Web Worker in the browser.
- [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore): user
  preferences, with a kotlinx.serialization `OkioSerializer` in place of the JVM-only protobuf one.
  The browser has no filesystem, so it stores the same serialized bytes in `localStorage`.
- [Landscapist](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist): image loading on every target through
  `LandscapistImage` and its own engine. The engine decodes no SVG and every topic icon is one, so
  `landscapist-svg`'s `SvgImageDecoder` wraps the raster decoder and rasterises them (AndroidSVG on
  Android, Skia's `SVGDOM` elsewhere). Loading states use `ShimmerPlugin` from
  `landscapist-placeholder`, which takes the shape of the image it replaces. Upstream's fixed 80.dp
  spinner covered half of a news header and was clamped to a ring on a 32.dp topic icon.
- [Navigation 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3): the back stack is a
  list of route objects the app owns. Upstream had already migrated to Navigation 3, so its
  multi-back-stack `Navigator`/`NavigationState` port over essentially unchanged, list-detail scene
  strategy and all.
- [Compose Navigation Graph](https://github.com/skydoves/compose-nav-graph): extracts the navigation
  graph at compile time from `@NavDestination`/`@NavEdge`, so a destination or transition cannot
  change unnoticed.
- [Compose HotSwan](https://hotswan.dev/): hot reload for the running Android app, wired as an
  opt-in Gradle flag.
- [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine)
  and [kotlinx-coroutines-test](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/master/kotlinx-coroutines-test)
  for testing `Flow`.
- [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) for JSON, preferences,
  and the saved back stack, plus [KSP](https://github.com/google/ksp) for Room and the navigation
  graph.

## Architecture

The layering is unchanged
from [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) and
from the upstream app: a UI layer over a data layer, with a small domain layer of use cases, and
dependencies pointing only downward.

<p align="center">

</p>

Every module above is a Kotlin Multiplatform module whose `commonMain` holds the real
implementation. Platform source sets exist only where a platform genuinely differs, and each one is
a named seam rather than a scattering of `if (isAndroid)` checks.

### What was platform-specific, and what replaced it

| Concern         | Android original            | Here                                                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DI              | Hilt / Dagger               | Metro `@DependencyGraph`, one per platform                                     |
| Networking      | Retrofit + OkHttp           | Ktor + Sandwich, engine per platform                                           |
| Demo data       | `assets/` + `AssetManager`  | Compose Resources `Res.readBytes("files/…")`                                   |
| Database        | Room 2 (Android)            | Room 3; `sqlite-bundled` natively, `sqlite-web` in a Web Worker in the browser |
| Preferences     | Proto DataStore             | DataStore + `OkioStorage`; `localStorage` in the browser                       |
| Images          | Coil 2                      | Landscapist + `landscapist-svg`                                                |
| Resources       | `R.string` / `R.drawable`   | Compose Resources, one `Res` per module                                        |
| Connectivity    | `ConnectivityManager`       | `ConnectivityManager` / `NWPathMonitor` / interface poll / `navigator.onLine`  |
| Time zone       | `ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED`   | broadcast on Android, poll elsewhere                                           |
| Notifications   | `NotificationCompat`        | `NotificationCompat` / `UNUserNotificationCenter` / AWT tray                   |
| Background sync | WorkManager                 | WorkManager on Android, a mutex-guarded app-scope coroutine elsewhere          |
| Deep links      | Activity `SavedStateHandle` | app-scoped `DeepLinkStore` written by each platform's entry point              |
| Jank tracking   | JankStats                   | `JankMetricsState`, a no-op off Android                                        |
| Open a link     | Chrome Custom Tabs          | Custom Tabs / `UIApplication.openURL` / `java.awt.Desktop` / `window.open`     |

### Running in a browser

The web demo lives at *
*[skydoves.github.io/nowinandroid-kmp](https://skydoves.github.io/nowinandroid-kmp/)**.
[`deploy-web.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml) builds `wasmJsBrowserDistribution` on every
push
to `main` and publishes it to GitHub Pages, so the demo is always the current state of the branch.

The wasm target reuses `commonMain` unchanged; `wasmJsMain` joins the same `nonAndroidMain` source
set as iOS and desktop, so most platform seams are already satisfied. Three things are genuinely
browser-only:

- **The database runs in a Web Worker.** `androidx.sqlite:sqlite-web` is the only wasm driver, and
  it
  ships the Kotlin half of a worker protocol without the worker, so `app/webApp` supplies one over
  the official SQLite WASM build. That build is compiled with FTS5 and no FTS4, while Room only
  offers `@Fts3`/`@Fts4`, so the worker rewrites `USING FTS4(...)` to `USING fts5(...)`. The app
  only
  ever asks the FTS tables for `MATCH`, `count(*)` and inserts, which behave the same either way.
- **The database is in memory.** Persisting to OPFS requires the page to be cross-origin isolated,
  so the browser build re-syncs on load instead. Preferences still persist, in `localStorage`.
- **Topic icons are served from this origin.** The demo data points them at a Firebase Storage
  bucket
  that answers browsers without an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, so the fetch is blocked
  before any decoder sees it. The nineteen icons are copied into the web app and requests rewritten
  to point there. Some news header images come from hosts with the same restriction and fall back to
  the placeholder; fixing those needs a proxy rather than a code change.

### Offline first

Reads come exclusively from the local database, so every screen renders without a network round
trip. `changeListSync` fetches the change list since the last sync, deletes what the server deleted,
pulls the changed models in batches of 40, and only then advances the stored version. That is the
same "git fetch / git pull / move HEAD" shape as upstream, now with the fetch modelled as an
`ApiResponse`.

Search is Room's FTS4 index over titles, content, and topic descriptions. FTS4 honours a trailing
`*` only, so `"*query*"` is really a prefix match; that is equally true on Android, and the upstream
spelling is kept so behaviour matches.

## Building

```bash
# Android
./gradlew :app:androidApp:installDebug

# Desktop
./gradlew :app:desktopApp:run

# Desktop installers (dmg / msi / deb)
./gradlew :app:desktopApp:packageDistributionForCurrentOS

# Web (wasmJs), served at localhost:8080
./gradlew :app:webApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun

# iOS: generate the Xcode project, then build or open it
./scripts/generate-xcodeproj.sh
open app/iosApp/NowInAndroid.xcodeproj
```

Requires JDK 21 (the Gradle daemon toolchain is pinned in `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`),
the Android SDK, and Xcode plus [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) for iOS.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no `iosX64` target: Room 3 and `androidx.sqlite` 2.7 stopped publishing it, so the
> simulator slice is Apple Silicon only and `EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*] = x86_64` is set in
> the Xcode project.

## Testing

**157 unit tests**, almost all of them in `commonTest`, so the same suite runs on three runtimes:

```bash
./gradlew desktopTest              # 157 tests on the desktop JVM
./gradlew testAndroidHostTest      # 117 of them on the Android host JVM
./gradlew iosSimulatorArm64Test    # 138 of them on the iOS simulator
./gradlew spotlessCheck            # formatting and license headers
./gradlew navCheck                 # navigation graph baselines (all seven modules)
```

They cover the data layer (`changeListSync` incremental sync, deletion, first-run read marking,
notification fan-out), the real Room SQL including the `CASE WHEN` filters and the many-to-many
join, the DataStore serializer, the Ktor + Sandwich success/HTTP-error/transport-failure branches,
all six feature ViewModels, the multi-back-stack `Navigator`, and `NiaAppState` under a real
composition via `runComposeUiTest`.

Three groups cannot run everywhere, and each is in a source set that says so:

| Where                                                | Why                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nonAndroidTest`, Room DAO tests                     | the bundled SQLite driver loads a JNI library an Android *host* test cannot                                                  |
| `nonAndroidTest`, `runComposeUiTest` cases           | an Android host test has no window to compose into                                                                           |
| `desktopTest`, sync tests over the bundled demo JSON | Compose Resources needs a `Context` on Android, and a Kotlin/Native test binary is not handed a dependency's resource bundle |

The browser target is deliberately not in that matrix. `wasmJsMain` joins `nonAndroidMain` so it
inherits the shared platform code, but `wasmJsTest` does not join `nonAndroidTest`, whose reason for
existing is Room's bundled SQLite JNI library. The browser has no JNI and no bundled driver.

## Hot reload

[Compose HotSwan](https://hotswan.dev/) reloads Compose changes into the app already running on the
device. Edit a composable, save, and the screen updates in place, keeping the state you had: the
topics you followed, how far you had scrolled, which screen you were on. No rebuild, no reinstall,
no navigating back to where you were.
