/**
 * The persisted shape of the user's preferences.
 *
 * The Android original stored this as a protobuf message, which is javalite-only and therefore
 * JVM-bound. Serialising the same field set with kotlinx.serialization keeps the storage format
 * readable and works on every target. The `map<string, bool>` pseudo-sets from the proto become
 * real `Set<String>`s, and the two legacy "deprecated_*" migration fields are gone: they only
 * existed to upgrade installs of the Android app, which by definition cannot exist here.
